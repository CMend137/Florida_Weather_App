This is a Pyhton-based project that was created in my undergradaute years in my university for my Human-Computer Interaction course.
The program uttilizes Streamlit which takes the user to a webpage with the app created on it. 
User can get curren weather reports on certain Floridian cities alongside wind speed, temperature, and much more.
Added my original lab report on my results and experience creating this program for the entire semester.
